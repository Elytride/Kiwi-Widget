## ‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏èIMPORTANT !!‚ö†Ô∏è‚ö†Ô∏è
*   Please refer to package.json for the specific versions of packages needed. Installing the latest packages directly will cause a bunch of errors, please use stable release versions of the packages instead.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd yourRepository'sDirectoryName
```

### 2. Install Dependencies
```
npm install
```
or
```
yarn install
```
### 3. Configure API Key
You must add your Google Gemini API key for the AI features to work. (API key is included for the submission for the hackathon)

Open the file: src/KiwiWidget.jsx

Find the line defining GEMINI_API_KEY:

```
const GEMINI_API_KEY = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY"; // Replace with your actual key
```
Replace "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY" with your actual API key obtained from Google AI Studio.

‚ö†Ô∏è Important: Do not commit your actual API key to version control (e.g., Git). If deploying or sharing, use environment variables or other secure methods to handle keys. 

### 4. Run the Development Server
```
npm run dev
```
# or
```
yarn dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, typically available at http://localhost:5173 (the exact port might vary). Open this URL in your browser to see the widget.

üìú Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run:

```
npm run dev
```
or 
```
yarn dev
```
Runs the app in development mode. Open http://localhost:5173 (or the specified port) to view it in the browser. The page will reload if you make edits.

```
npm run build
```
or 
```
yarn build
```
Builds the app for production to the dist folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

```
npm run lint
```
or
```
yarn lint
```
Runs the ESLint checker to find potential issues in the code.

```
npm run preview
```
or 
```
